FWI Predictor – A Machine Learning Model to Predict Fire Weather Index

Project Statement Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, human life, and property. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a crucial tool used by meteorological and environmental agencies worldwide to estimate wildfire potential. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts FWI based on real-time environmental data, enabling proactive wildfire risk management. The model is trained using Ridge Regression, deployed via a Flask web application, and supports early warning systems for wildfire hazards.

Outcomes:
• A predictive ML model trained using Ridge Regression to forecast FWI.
• A pre-processing pipeline using StandardScaler for normalization.
• A Flask-based web app where users can input environmental values and get FWI predictions. • A system that can help forest departments, emergency planners, and climate researchers make data driven decisions.

Modules to be implemented
• Data Collection
• Data Exploration (EDA) and Data Preprocessing
• Feature Engineering and Scaling
• Model Training using Ridge Regression
• Evaluation and Optimization
• Deployment via Flask App
• Presentation and Documentation

Web Application (Flask) Features:

- User-friendly form for entering weather and fire parameters
- Backend preprocessing using saved scaler
- Model inference using trained Ridge Regression model
- Fire risk classification (Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme)
